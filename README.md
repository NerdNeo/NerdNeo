- 👀 I’m interested in ...<br/><br/>
    I like to learn, so my interests extend far and wide. With that said, I do have a few hobbies that will always be around:
    <ul>
      <li>Music (I play a few instruments)</li>
      <li>Food (I love to cook)</li>
      <li>Photography (I like taking pictures of things... and then messing around with those pictures)</li>
      <li>Tech (I like to keep in the know about cool new stuff that I can play with... so maybe this should say toys?)</li>
      <li>Dad-ing (I have a 4 year old... she cool)</li>
      <li>Helping (I like doing work that means something.. that could help some people)</li>
      <li>Gaming (I like to play video games... as well as the occasional tabletop experience)</li>
      <li>Openness (I like to practice keeping an open mind and being ready to embrace change and opportunity)</li>
    </ul>
    
    
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...<br/><br/>
      I am currently working through The Odin Project's curriculum aiming to complete the full stack Javascript path.
      My goal is to get skilled enough at coding to land me a job... where I imagine the real learning will being.



- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...<br/><br/>
      Right now my coding skills are novice to intermediate level, I've been messing with HTML and CSS for years, I know a             little JS and SQL, but I'm really just getting back into things after a pretty long break. Eventually I want to find a           great place to work that pays me decent money, but as far as passion projects go, I am always open to ideas (and sharing         some of my own).



- 📫 How to reach me ...<br/>
      Through github right now is fine.
